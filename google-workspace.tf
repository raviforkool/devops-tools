provider "googleworkspace" {
  credentials = file("/path/to/key.json")
  domain      = "example.com"
}

#### Here's an example Terraform module that you can use to create a new user account in Google Workspace:

# main.tf

variable "admin_email" {}
variable "user_first_name" {}
variable "user_last_name" {}
variable "user_password" {}

provider "google" {
  version = "~> 3.0"
}

resource "google_directory_user" "new_user" {
  first_name = var.user_first_name
  last_name  = var.user_last_name
  password   = var.user_password
  primary_email = "${var.user_first_name}.${var.user_last_name}@your-domain.com"
  org_unit_path  = "/Users"

  depends_on = [
    google_directory_org_unit.main_org_unit,
  ]
}

resource "google_directory_org_unit" "main_org_unit" {
  name = "Users"
  parent_org_unit_path = "/"
}


###In this module, we're using the google_directory_user resource to create a new user account in Google Workspace. We're also using the google_directory_org_unit resource to create an organizational unit for the user account.
###To create a new user account in Google Workspace using this module, you can use the following Terraform code:

module "google_workspace_user" {
  source = "path/to/module"
  admin_email = "admin@your-domain.com"
  user_first_name = "John"
  user_last_name = "Doe"
  user_password = "my_password"
}
## This will create a new user account with the email address "john.doe@your-domain.com" and the password "my_password". The user will be added to the "Users" organizational unit.

##It's important to note that the exact details of creating a user account in Google Workspace using Terraform may vary depending on your organization's settings and requirements. It's always recommended to refer to the Google Workspace API documentation for specific details and requirements.
  
### Here's an example Bash script that you can use to create a new user account in Google Workspace:
  
  
#!/bin/bash

# Set the necessary variables
admin_email="admin@your-domain.com"
user_email="new-user@your-domain.com"
user_first_name="John"
user_last_name="Doe"
user_password="my_password"

# Call the Terraform module to create the user account
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve -var admin_email="$admin_email" -var user_email="$user_email" -var user_first_name="$user_first_name" -var user_last_name="$user_last_name" -var user_password="$user_password"
